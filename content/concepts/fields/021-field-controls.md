Field controls are client-side components that provide GUI for setting/modifying field values of a content. Thus, field controls are the basic building blocks of views that define how a content could be rendered.

Content build up of fields, and fields are presented with field controls when content are being presented on the ui (e.g. on the admin surface). Field controls provide user interfaces both for displaying and for editing field values.
