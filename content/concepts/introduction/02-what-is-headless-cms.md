Headless content management system (CMS) is the trend of the years past. It is built as a content repository where you can store your contents and reach it through RESTful APIs. It is reactive: another system requests the content as and when itâ€™s needed. Since it is a headless CMS there is no ui, so it is fully customizable. Thanks to its API-first concept it is easy to integrate with and gives more freedom to the developer to choose framework for his project.

# What's a headless CMS anyway?

- loosely connected, often interchangeable components
- easy to integrate with
- scalable
- fast and flexible content delivery
- future proof
- few publisher and developer dependencies
- simple deployment
- good for content centric solutions
