A basic setup of sensenet has three top level parts:
- a **content repository** that is the storage and service layer,

SNaaS is now hosted on sensenet's own cloud infrastructure in Europe. In the future we plan to support other popular and well-known cloud providers as well and allow our subscribers to choose the one they need or love making the content delivery even faster by taking advantages of CDN provided by the cloud providers.
