**sensenet** is an open-source [headless content management system (CMS)](/concepts/introduction/02-what-is-headless-cms) built mainly for developers and development companies.

It is a content repository where you can store all your content and reach it through APIs.
It is a solid base for your custom solutions, offering an enterprise-grade security and permission system, versioning, dynamic content types and even more.

# What can you do with it?

You can create, store, edit, organize, and publish any type of content.

In sensenet, everything is [content](/concepts/basics). Documents, tasks, users, projects, even system configuration files – everything – are stored and managed in the content repository. It is the foundation that makes content management easy and powerful at the same time. All content items are organized in a [content tree](/concepts/basics/02-content-tree), so you can always operate through subtrees and with inheritance when managing and presenting content.

In practice, this means that sensenet gives you everything you need to build content-based custom solutions to satisfy a wide variety of business needs.

# How can you do it?

Once you understand that ["everything is a content"](/concepts/basics), you can implement your own business logic by creating custom [content types](/concepts/content-management/02-content-models) or using predefined ones.

In sensenet, the delivery of content happens through APIs. Your solution requests the content as and when it is needed.

Due to its API-first approach, it is easy to integrate and gives more freedom to the developer to choose the database, framework, and programming language at all level of the application development, whether it is a web, desktop or mobile development project.

You can either install sensenet in your own environment or use sensenet as a service ([SNaaS](/concepts/introduction/04-what-is-snaas)), gaining access to a sensenet instance where we store and host all your content and data securely. SNaaS saves you time and energy by removing the need for installation and all maintenance-related tasks, ensuring easy onboarding, updates, and patches.

As an open-source software, the source code of sensenet backend and frontend components is fully public and available on GitHub. If you want to fully understand how it works or help us improve sensenet by fixing a bug or contributing a new feature, feel free to do it in the [GitHub repositories under Sense/Net organization](https://github.com/SenseNet).
