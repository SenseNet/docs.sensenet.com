In many cases developers and non-developers have to work together during a project. sensenet enables collaborative content management, keeping all your content on a single hub.

# Collaboration features

In sensenet it is possible to make real-time editing together with your collaborators, thanks to **Office Online Editing**.  **Versioning** feature is the management of changes to documents and other information stored in a file system or repository.
Using **simple approval**, contents needs to be sent for approval and can only be published when the review is finished and modification requests has been adapted.
