# What kind of content may have versions?
Any kind. Versioning is switched OFF by default, but you can switch it ON on any kind of content - even folders or workspaces.

# How do I see and restore old versions?
On the admin UI you will find a **Versions** menu item in context menus. There you can review and restore older versions.

# How can I delete old versions?
Currently this is not possible, all versions are preserved if versioning is switched ON.

# Who can see the versions of my file?
Major versions (like `1.0`, `2.0`) can be seen by anyone with `Open` or even `Preview` permissions. Minor versions (like `1.1D`, `2.3R`) are visible only to users with `OpenMinor` permission.
