In sensenet content repository you are able to search in any metadata field of any content. As the field values can be indexed for every content, when you search for a field value the related content will appear in the result set. Without adding a field name into the query to search for, the search engine will look into all the fields that's value is indexed.

Following query results every content that has the word *Lorem* in one of its indexed fields (e.g. DisplayName, Description or even the uploaded file's content):
