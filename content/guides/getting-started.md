sensenet has an admin ui which enables you to connect to your repos and do basic content management actions. In the following you can learn about the different features of the admin surface.

# Login

Admin ui is a central place to manage sensenet repositories by logging in to a specific repo with the correct credentials.
First, enter **repository URL** then log in using your email address (and password) or your Google, GitHub account.
