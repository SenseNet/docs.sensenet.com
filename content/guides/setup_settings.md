In sensenet you can make custom setting globally, from the Menu bar on the left, or locally, for example on a file or a folder.
To set for example watermark, it is possible to make it globally for each and every preview image from Menu bar/Setup/DocumetPreview.Settings.

In addition to that, you can define different watermarks for different workspaces (which will then overwrite global settings), or even set watermark to a specific doclib. 
Watermark is just one example of how versatile settings in sensenet can be, mainly due to the hierarchical tree structure, which forms the base of our content repository.
