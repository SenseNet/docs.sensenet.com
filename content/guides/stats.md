Stats page contains all the important info about your sensenet repo.

*Storage*

A sensenet content repository allows you to store and manage all your content for different solutions in one place. Since everything is a content in the same repository, configuration files, content types and templates all of these will decrease your available space in the storage. The available space depends on your plan what can be a Developer plan, Business plan or a personalized enterprise plan.

In the first box of **Settings / Stats** page you can see your repository space broken down into details. This diagram tells you for example how many users are in your repository or how much space the logs take up.

The Components part contains the latest dates of the releases and you can easily navigate to the release notes with the links next to the dates.
Below that the table lists you the components of your sensenet with the actual and latest versions, so you can make sure if your sensenet is up-to-date.
