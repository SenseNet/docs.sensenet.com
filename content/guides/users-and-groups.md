User and groups can be managed on the admin-ui in a dedicated section. Here you can add new user, organize them in groups and edit items one by one.

> You can add new user, group or organizational unit with the *add new* button (when you're in *Users and groups* section).

# Users

Since user management differs from group management (columns, actions etc.) admin-ui contains two different views. You can switch between them by using the selector at the top.

In *USERS* tab the following columns are displayed:

- Display name
- Email
- Roles - this column lists all groups the user is member of
- Enabled - is a specific user is disabled, it cannot log in to the system
- Actions - basic actions (Browse, Copy, Edit or Move user)

By clicking

# Groups

*GROUPS* tab is slightly different. It contains the following:

- Display name - like on *USERS* tab
- Description - a simple long text field
- Members - shows how many member a specific group contains
- Actions - basic actions (Browse, Copy, Edit or Move user)
