# Create new content on admin ui (upload file, folder)
In sensenet contents are organized in tree structure. It is possible to create a content from zero or to upload a file or folder. This is to bring a short exmample how you can create a new content in sensenet.

# Create new
Folders are nodes in the tree structure. They can contain files and/ or other folders.
To create a new folder click on _Content_ in the menu structure on the left. You will see the basic built-in workspaces in sensenet, containing default content types, folders and files. For example Marketing workspace contains Document Library, Image library, Memos, Calendar etc., all of these contains different contents.
In the sensenet content repository it is possible to define restrictions on what content types the different containers can contain (allow child type). For example a Calendar can only contain Events, a Document Library can only contain Folders and Files, etc. This allows you to create a much more precisely defined content structure and provides control on the long run. These settings can be overridden on the specific content, for example you can modify any of your document libraries to contain images too. T

If you would like to create for example a new folder, first you select selecting where you would like to create a it.
To create the folder click on _Add_ and among other content types (like Calendar, Memo ect.) you have the possibility to create _Folder_.

In the opening window you can give the folder name, you can define the lifespan (the content is valid, visible from date to date), and also you can define the indexing. This last one is useful while filtering and sorting the content: for example you create different contents at the same time and you would like to put them in custom order, so you give them an index value, this way you can filter and order them based on this indexing.

# Upload file
It is possible to create a new content in sensenet also by uploading a file or a complete folder. You can do it in the same way, by clicking on Add in the menu in the left and select Upload. 
It is possible to upload images, pdf, word, excel or ppt files.

Basically, all the new content you would like to create in sensenet you can do in the same way, using the _Add_ function in the Menu.
